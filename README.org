* Using Linux to Create Content for High Fidelity

I'm a computer programmer, and a fan of virtual worlds.  I especially
like the virtual worlds that enable user-created content, though I
don't have much skill at creating 3D Models.  Sometimes I run [[https://www.blender.org/][Blender]]
and admire its many buttons.  Despite this lack of skill, I've found
that I can make quite a variety of things with a small set of
programmer-friendly tools: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/][GNU Make]], [[http://www.meshlab.net/][Meshlab]], [[http://www.openscad.org/][OpenSCAD]],
[[https://github.com/sethalves/wavefront-obj-tools][wavefront-obj-tool]], [[http://www.povray.org/][POV-Ray]], [[https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php][convert from ImageMagick]], [[http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/][Netpbm]].

I've started writing /lab reports/ about making content
for High Fidelity.  They assume you're already reasonably
familiar with High Fidelity and that you're comfortable
with Linux.  I imagine this is a small audience.  Anyway,
as I write them, I'll link to them from here:
